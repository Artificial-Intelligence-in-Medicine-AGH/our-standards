# Our Standards

This repository defines the guidelines for project development within our organization.  
It’s divided into multiple files — each focusing on a specific aspect of our workflow — to ensure clarity and maintain a consistent, unified codebase.

## English

First and foremost: **everything should be written in English.**  
That includes code, documentation, README files, issues, and pull request discussions.  
In short — if it’s on GitHub, it should be in English.

### Why English?

- It’s the global standard in IT - mastering it improves communication and professionalism.
- Code and documentation are easier to read and maintain in English.
- We aim to stay inclusive and open to non-Polish contributors.
