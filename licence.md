# License

For open source projects, it is essential to include a license. The default license we use is MIT, but if the project has specific requirements, another license may be chosen.

## Why the MIT license?

The MIT license is ideal for projects we want to share openly with the world. It allows others to freely use and modify the work, with the only requirement being to credit the original author, which in our case is AI Med.

## How to add a license to a project

The easiest way is on the GitHub repository page: click **Add file** -> **Create new file**.  
Name the file `LICENSE` (all uppercase, with no file extension). GitHub will then offer an option to **Choose a license template**. Click on it and select the MIT license template, click **Review and submit**, and you will return to the file editing page. Finally, commit the changes.

That’s it!

## Closed-source projects

Closed-source projects do not require a license file, as they are for internal use only.  
**However, remember to add an appropriate license file if the project source code is ever made public.**
